# Extended Kalman Filter Algorithm for Neural Training

This code base is using the Julia Language and [DrWatson](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/stable/)
to make a reproducible scientific project named
> Extended Kalman Filter Algorithm for Neural Training

To (locally) reproduce this project, do the following

This code base is meant to develop scripts for a server without graphical interface. A Julia docker image with the precompiled dependencies is recommended to avoid computational overhead.

.jl files in scripts directory run independently with dependencies installed and compiled during execution if necessary.
