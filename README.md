# Extended Kalman Filter Algorithm for Neural Training

This code base is meant to develop scripts for a server without graphical interface. A Julia docker image with the precompiled dependencies is used to avoid computational overhead.

.jl files in scripts directory run from bash with module compiled before execution and loading precompiled dependencies.
